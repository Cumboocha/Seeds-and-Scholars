        This is a hidden gem for vegetarian Filipino comfort food! Their laing and gising-gising were full of flavor—rich, creamy, and satisfying without any meat or seafood. I loved how the dishes tasted just like home-cooked meals, and the prices are very affordable. Even my non-vegetarian friends enjoyed the food. It’s rare to find a karinderya that puts gulay front and center—definitely coming back!
